<h3 align="left">🔭 Overview</h3>

Posterfy is a web application that allows users to create posters for their favorite albums using data and images from Spotify's free API. Users can search for albums, select one, and Posterfy will gather the necessary information and organize it visually using the HTML canvas element. The project is open source and does not generate any revenue. All rights to images and information belong to Spotify and the respective artists.
