## 🔭 **Overview**

Posterfy is a full-stack web application that allows users to create visually appealing posters for their favorite music albums. Built with a modern architecture featuring:

- **Frontend**: React-based SPA with responsive design and multilingual support
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express API with OAuth authentication (Google & Spotify)
- **Database**: MongoDB for user management and data persistence
- **Integration**: Spotify Web API for album data and artwork

Powered by Spotify's free API, Posterfy enables users to search for albums, gather album data, and organize the information into custom posters using the **HTML Canvas** element.

This project is educational, non-commercial, and fully open to contributions. All rights to the images and data are owned by Spotify and the respective artists.

## 🔧 **How It Works**

### User Journey
1️⃣ **Authentication**: Users sign in with Google or Spotify OAuth for secure access.

2️⃣ **Profile Management**: Create and manage user profiles with unique usernames.

3️⃣ **Album Search**: Users enter the name of the album they want to create a poster for.

4️⃣ **Album Selection**: Posterfy displays search results from Spotify's database, and users select their desired album.

5️⃣ **Data Gathering**: Once the album is selected, Posterfy fetches all the necessary data and images from Spotify's Web API.

6️⃣ **Poster Customization**: Users can customize poster layouts, colors, fonts, and styling options.

7️⃣ **Visual Organization**: The gathered data is then visually organized into a custom layout using the HTML Canvas element.

8️⃣ **Poster Generation**: Finally, a rendered image of the poster is generated, which the user can save or share.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- MongoDB (local installation or cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
- Spotify Developer Account (for API credentials)
- Google OAuth credentials (optional, for Google authentication)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/avictormorais/posterfy.git
   cd posterfy
   ```

2. **Set up the backend**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure backend environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory:
   ```env
   # Database
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/posterfy
   
   # JWT Authentication (recommended for serverless deployments)
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=30d
   
   # Session (legacy - not used with JWT)
   SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret-key
   
   # OAuth - Google (optional)
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
   
   # OAuth - Spotify
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
   
   # Server
   PORT=5000
   NODE_ENV=development
   CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
   ```

4. **Set up the frontend**
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

5. **Configure frontend environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the `client/` directory:
   ```env
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
   VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
   ```

6. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   cd ../server
   npm start
   ```
   The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`

7. **Start the frontend development server**
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will run on `http://localhost:5173`

8. **Open your browser**
   
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to see the application running.

### Production Build

To build both frontend and backend for production:

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd client
npm run build
```
